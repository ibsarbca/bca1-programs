# Some things to note

* Mainly, only GUI (Swing, Applets, AWT) programs and Thread programs have been included

* This is because most programs seem to be the same ones as in the other semesters, i.e. palindrome, armstrong, etc.

* Some non-GUI programs have been included however for various reasons.
