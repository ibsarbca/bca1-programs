# Some things to note

* Mainly, only GUI (Swing, Applets, AWT) programs and Thread programs have been included

* This is because most programs seem to be the same ones as in the other semesters, i.e. palindrome, armstrong, etc.

* Some non-GUI programs have been included however for various reasons.

* Regarding the "Calculator" program: This is a very complicated program that is feasible in .NET but not so feasible in Java with Swing / AWT. Therfore this program has  not been included since it is not know just how large this program needs to be. There are simple ways to do a calculator, however since it is not known exactly which way is correct, this program has been removed entirely.
