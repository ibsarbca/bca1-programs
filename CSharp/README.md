# Things to note

Most simple console applications are not included.

Most programs should work in .NET Framework 2.0

Most Generic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) applications are not included unless they're particularly difficult. This is because the code is basically the same, with the only difference being the names of the rows.

Validation Programs are not included except one, which demonstrates all Validators.

OOPS Stuff has not been included.
